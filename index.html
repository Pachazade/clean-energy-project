  <h1>Affordable and Clean Energy</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Energy has an important role in our lives and is used in almost every part of daily life. However, are we really using energy in a way that is good for the world? In most cases, the answer is no, except for some special situations. The increasing use of fossil fuels has caused serious environmental problems, which is why clean energy has become an important topic today.</p>

<h2>What Is Clean Energy?</h2>
<p>Clean energy refers to energy sources that produce low carbon emissions and are better for the environment because they do not use carbon dioxide. The main types of clean energy include hydropower, geothermal, solar, wind, nuclear, and bioenergy. These energy sources are considered clean because they do not emit greenhouse gases like fossil fuels. For this reason, clean energy plays an important role in reducing climate change. </p>

<h2>Why Is Clean Energy Important?</h2>
<p>As the world population increases, energy becomes more important in our daily lives, such as transportation, jobs, and industry. However, many people still rely on fossil fuels, which damage the environment by releasing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Governments often prefer fossil fuels because they are cheaper and provide jobs, while large companies want to maintain their economic power. Although these choices may seem beneficial in the short term, they cause serious harm to the Earth. The continued use of fossil fuels leads to climate change and global environmental problems. If climate change is not stopped, water scarcity may become a major issue, and it is estimated that one-third of the world’s population could struggle to access clean water. In addition, many species may become extinct due to rising temperatures. Melting glaciers can cause sea levels to rise, flooding some cities, and even lead to the emergence of new viruses. For these reasons, clean energy is essential for protecting the environment and ensuring a sustainable future. Without a transition to clean energy sources, the negative effects of climate change will continue to grow.</p>

<h2>The Role of the United Nations</h2>
<p>Of course, the United Nations did not remain indifferent to these global problems. The UN created several agreements and goals, such as Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13, to address clean energy and climate change. In Sustainable Development Goal 7, the United Nations planned important steps to support clean energy for the future. Some of the main targets of SDG 7 are:

1-By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.

2-By 2030, substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.

3-By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.

4-By 2030, enhance international cooperation to support clean energy research, technology, and investment.

5-By 2030, improve energy infrastructure and provide sustainable energy services, especially in developing countries.

In addition, the United Nations prepared the Paris Agreement together with its member countries. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2°C, and preferably to 1.5°C. This agreement supports the use of clean energy and helps reduce the negative effects of climate change on the planet and human health. </p>

<h2>Current Global Problems</h2>
<p>With climate change, several serious global problems have emerged. Some of the main problems are:

1-Since the mid-19th century, the global average temperature has increased by approximately 1.5°C.

2-Due to this temperature rise, extreme and warm weather events have become more frequent around the world.

3-Glaciers are melting as a result of rising temperatures, which contributes to sea level rise.

4-Animals are negatively affected by global warming, and many species are now endangered because of climate change.

5-In the future, water scarcity may become a serious problem, which could lead to loss of life and even conflicts over water resources.</p>

<h2>What Can We Do as Individuals?</h2>
<p>As individuals, we can also make changes to protect the environment. Firstly, we can prefer environmentally friendly energy sources such as solar energy and reduce the use of fossil fuels. In addition, using public transportation can help decrease the number of cars on the roads and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, manufacturers can sustain their factories by using renewable and clean energy instead of fossil fuels, and filters can be installed to reduce toxic gas emissions.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, clean energy is very important for the future of our world. Fossil fuels cause climate change and many environmental problems, while clean energy sources are safer for nature and human health. Organizations such as the United Nations and agreements like the Paris Agreement show that global cooperation is necessary. If governments, companies, and individuals work together, clean energy can help create a more sustainable and better future./p>
